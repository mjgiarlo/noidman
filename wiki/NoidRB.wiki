= Noid.rb: A Ruby noid client =

<p>
Noid.rb is a Ruby library that acts as a facade for the Perl-based [http://www.cdlib.org/inside/diglib/ark/noid.pdf Noid] tool developed at the California Digital Library.  Noid.rb wraps a number of Noid functions and also provides a few extra capabilities for finding and dumping Noid-minted identifiers.
