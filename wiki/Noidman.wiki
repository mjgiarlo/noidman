<p>
Noidman is a Ruby on Rails-based web application for creating, managing, validating, and resolving persistent identifiers.  It is built around the Archival Resource Key identifier schema and is essentially a web front-end for the Noid (nice opaque identifier) tool released by the California Digital Library.  Noidman thus depends upon the Perl-based Noid tool, wrapping its functions in a Ruby facade class, [NoidRB Noid.rb].
</p>
<p>
Note that I do not intend to continue developing Noidman; the coupling with the Noid tool was too limiting, and so I'm pouring all of my development time into [Arkham] instead.  Still, you may find the Noidman code useful and it's available now.
